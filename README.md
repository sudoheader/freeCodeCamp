# freeCodeCamp

Some notes about [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)

1. It has an option to download solutions (in json) after completing problems.
2. After pressing "Run the Tests" and "Submit and go to next challenge (Ctrl + Enter)", there will be no option to go back and download the solution. You either need to copy/paste your solution and then download before continuing to the next problem, otherwise your progress will be lost.
